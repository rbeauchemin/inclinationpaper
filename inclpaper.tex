\section{Introduction}

The introduction should contain sufficient
background on the topic of your research that the reader understands what
you are doing and why. It is important here and elsewhere in the paper to
cite references when appropriate. While one can do this manually -- e.g
(Vollbach et al. 1997), the easiest was to do this is with bibtex and the
cite commands, because this automatically updates the references in both
the text and the reference list at the end. For example, you can put the
reference \cite{hamann2008}, or if you want it in line rather than in
braces, then \citet{hamann2008}. To compile the documents you must then
also have a .bib file (e.g. ast4723.bib) that contains the ADS bibtex entry, with
the article name given as hamann2008, as in the example with this document.
The document are then compiled by typing:

bibtex ast4723
latex ast4723.tex ; dvips -o ast4723.ps ast4723.dvi
latex ast4723.tex ; dvips -o ast4723.ps ast4723.dvi

Mote that you have to latex it twice after adding references for all the references
to get updated.
The following examples of sections are intended to provide a rough guideline for how
you may wish to structure your paper. You are not required to maintain this format,
but should use a similar, sensible approach.

You may need to have emulateapj.cls in the same directory as your document.


\section{Observations}

In this section you should describe your observations. Look at a real paper (or
at least the sample.tex file with emulateapj) to get an idea for what is appropriate
in this section. Be sure to include information about what nights you observed
and any key issues related to your data quality.  If you are using archival data,
then you should describe when the data was originally obtained and still describe 
things such as the instrument and telescope.

\section{Data Reductions}

This section is your chance to describe everything that you did to process your data.
List clearly how you reduced the data and did the photometry. If you wish to divide
this into subsections, you can do so as illustrated below.
\subsection{Bias Subtraction and Flatfielding}
To subtract the bias, we...
\subsection{Really weird stuff that I had to do for my data}
There was a bad region shaped like a parrot in the middle of the detector, which required...
\subsection{Image Stacking}
We aligned the images using...
\subsection{Photometric Calibration}

\section{Data Analysis}

This section should describe the scientific analysis done for your project. If you are
making a light curve for example, here is where you would describe how you made it and what you measured.
Remember that your write-up should contain figures, such as Figure \ref{fig:test}. Note that this
reference to the figure is collected to a label in the figure caption, so if you add others the
number will automatically update

\begin{figure}
\plotone{fig1.pdf}
\caption{An example of a figure included in the text. \label{fig:test}}
\end{figure}

\section{Results and Discussion (can easily be separate sections)}

Fairly self explanatory. You should think carefully about what your results 
mean. Speculation is good, but it should be grounded in the data -- wild
speculation is bad.  If you want to add any equations in the text, this
can be done in the fashion below. Note that the online latex references, 
including the ones linked off the web page, provide the necessary information
for constructing more complex equations. If you want to include equation
symbols inline in the text, then you place them between dollar signs, as
shown below.

Consider the equation
\begin{equation}
\bar v = \exp(\tau^{-1})
\end{equation}
where $\bar v$ is the mean velocity of a purple balloon, and $\tau$ is
the mean free path of the balloon. If we have a velocity $\bar v = 5\pm1$ km s$^{-1}$,
what is $\tau$?

One last item that we have not discussed is tables. There is an example in this
document in Table \ref{tab:test}, which is the same as in sample.tex.

\appendix

\section{Appendix material}

If you want to go into a lot of detail about something that you feel doesn't belong
in the main part of the paper, this would be the place to do it. 

For this document, I will simply note that for the bibliographies, the manual
way of including a bibliography is
\begin{verbatim}

\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}

while the automated way, assuming that you have generated a .bib file is
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{apj}
\bibliography{ast4723}
\end{verbatim}

which for the file ast4723.bib and this tex file generates the reference list
seen below. A nice aspect of this approach is that if you don't use a reference
in the paper it automatically gets removed from the reference list at the end.
The one additional file that you need to have for this approach is apj.bst,
which is posted on the web page.
